## üêæ Rescue Animal Management System (IT-145)

This object-oriented Java program is designed to manage rescue animals in a training and deployment system. It models animals using classes with inherited and encapsulated data, and allows users to input, retrieve, and manage information about available rescue animals.

### Features

- Accepts and stores detailed information about each animal (e.g., name, type, age, training status)
- Allows users to:
  - Add new animals to the system
  - View available animals by type and service location
  - Reserve animals for service
- Implements encapsulation through private instance variables and public getter/setter methods
- Demonstrates inheritance through extension of shared attributes across animal types (e.g., Dog, Monkey, etc.)

### Object-Oriented Design

- **Main class:** `RescueAnimal.java`
- **Inherits from:** Three other classes 
- **Encapsulation:** All instance variables are private with controlled access through getters and setters
- **Extendability:** Designed to support additional animal types and behaviors

### Concepts Used

- Class inheritance and object composition
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Java object instantiation
- Boolean flags and status tracking
- Console-based data entry and retrieval
